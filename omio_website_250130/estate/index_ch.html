Fortunately, Spanish legal system offers several legal business structures that offer you tax benefits, depending on your activity. This is the main reason why you will need a Spanish expert advisor in these kind of issues. The most common legal business structures used for the most companies in Spain are Limited Liability Company (Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada) and Public Limited Company ( Sociedad Anonima). <br><br>
		4. The forth step, the partners of the company will deposit a sum of money which will consequently create the Capital Stock, and with this each partner of the company will have obtained share. <br><br>
		5. Once you have decided what is to be the structure of the company and the capital stock has been contributed, you have to formalize it before a Notary Public because it is obligatory to register in the Commercial Register and for that moment the company will obtain the N.I.F., this number is necessary for operating and developing the activity. Obviously, this kind of company must pay tax contributions. Generally the main tax for companies is the corporation tax, for which basically the company must pay the thirty five percent of the profits of the company.<br><br>

        <h1 class="light">golden visa</h1>
        <p>We have a reputation for providing high quality legal advice on immigration issues. This expertise has been acquired over the last years as the demand for this kind of service has increased exponentially. Because of this we are able to assist clients who wish to take advantage of the new immigration regulation that relates to Spanish Investment Visas and Spanish Residency Visas. In order to benefit from the new law, which significantly eases access to Visas, it is compulsory to either buy a property worth 500,000 Euros, or to obtain shares from Spanish companies with a minimum value of 1,000,000 Euros.<br><br><br>
    	This Investment /Residency Visa will allow the applicants to reside in Spain, initially, for a one year period. During this period, the applicants will only need to enter Spanish territory once. In addition, holders of these Visas will be able to travel around the Schengen territory for 90 days every 180 days (3 months every 6 months). A key value of the new regulation is that, after one year, applicants will be entitled to apply for residency permits which will enable them to live and work in Spain for an additional two years. Moreover, they will be in position to apply for European residency to live and work in other member states of the European Union.<br><br><br>
		Initially, interested individuals have to apply for an investment/ residency visa at the Spanish Embassy in their home country. At this stage, the applicants will have to prove having made an investment of 500,000 Euros in property or having obtained shares from Spanish companies with a minimum value of 1,000,000 Euros. Presenting the documentation in the correct form is a complicated and time consuming process as applicants are required to present a number of translated and legalized documents regarding their personal and economic situation. When submitted correctly, Spanish Institutions must grant the Investment /Residency Visa within 10 days from the date of filing the application.<br><br><br>
		Our legal practice offers highly professional personalized assistance to clients throughout the entire process: from property purchase / investment, to the preparation of residency visa application forms and the necessary official documentation to satisfy the requirements of the new immigration regulation.<br><br><br>

        <p>The Spanish property market has now regained the strength and vitality it once enjoyed, yet with more cautious and sound leverage and operating ratios than in the years immediately preceding the crisis. Leverage ratios are well under 60% LTVs, affordability rates steadily increase, vacancies shrink and all types of real estate are being managed with more skill and professionalism than in the old days. Throughout this long 10-year period, the real estate community members have done their best to make this trend crystallise. Indeed, some of the most powerful drivers of the change have demanded the joint action and effort of multiple parties: public authorities, the financial community, real estate investors, developers, brokers and consultants and last, but not least, lawyers.<br><br>
